    "Let's create some time series from the data. You may choose to analyze either users or tags. To analyze users, take the top 100 users with the most question posts. For each user, your time series will be the number of questions posted by that user at some frequency. To analyze tags, take the top 100 most popular question tags. For each tag, your time series will be the number of questions with that tag at some frequency. You may choose to sample your data each week, each month, on a certain day of the week or at certain hours in a day depending on what trend you are hoping to find in the data. For example, if you choose to analyze tags and sample during different hours of the day, your hypothesis could be that languages (i.e. Javascript) that are used more in industry will have more questions posted during work hours, whereas languages (i.e. Python) that are taught in academia will have more questions posted after midnight when students are scrambling to finish their homework.\n",

I chose to use Minkowski distance because it was one of the distance metrics included in the time series notes.  P is set to 1 because Minkowski generalizes Euclidean distance for p = 2 and the result may not be meaningful.  For this dataset I hoped to find a trend for the users with the most activity to be posting questions consistently throughout the year and users who were not frequently on the site to post more sporadically.  The time series measures the similiarity between two users using their frequencies of question posts as data objects being passed in and compared.  \n",
